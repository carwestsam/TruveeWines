                    Fittingly derived from the French verb 'to find' Truvée [TRUE-VAY] is a reflection of our vision that grew out of two individual stories.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both grew up independently of each other in emerging wine regions (New Zealand and California) —each fostering our own appreciation for the craft of winemaking, unaware of one another's existence for nearly half of our lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our father’s final wish was "to find" and connect his two daughters, and with the help of his family and despite the 7,000 miles that separated us, we were united for the first time in 1999 at the ages of 16 and 25. After connecting, we formed a deep and lasting friendship, and also discovered our mutual interest in the art of grape growing and winemaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marrying 10 plus years of experience in the wine industry as négociants, and <a href="http://www.ecolovewines.com/" target="_blank">creators of eco.love Wines from New Zealand</a>, we have crafted another authentic, but affordable luxury wine, this time from select vineyards within the Central Coast of California. Our vision for Truvée is to make delicious wines everyone can enjoy and inspire people "to find" what matters most to them.

                    Cheers!
