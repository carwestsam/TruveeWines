				<span>WINE</span>
			</h3>
			<p>
				<span>
					Made from premiere vineyards on the Central Coast, the 2014 Chardonnay has an elegance and poise that stylistically sits between Old World and New World. The fruit is bright and fresh, combining citrus, pear and granny smith apples with delicate notes of tropical fruit and honeysuckle. Suggestions of oak weave subtly through the wine, lending texture, body and a fine layer of spicy vanilla tones. Juicy and lush, the flavors extend across the palate and into a bright, lingering finish.

			<h3>
				<span>VINYARD</span>
			</h3>
			<p>
				<span>
					The grapes for our Chardonnay come from several vineyards throughout the Central Coast, selected for their sustainable practices and stunning, fruit-driven profile. A little over half the wine comes from Edna Valley, a unique location that runs east to west, just 10 miles off the Pacific Ocean. With serpentine soils and a variety of aspects, the vineyards produce fruit with intense tropical flavors and bright acidity. In Santa Barbara, our grapes come from the Bien Nacido Vineyard, a breathtaking site with state-of-the-art practices and exceptional Chardonnay loaded with distinctive mineral and floral notes. Finally we layered in fruit from Chalone&nbsp;adding depth and complexity to the final wine.

			<h3>
				<span>WINEMAKING</span>
			</h3>
			<p>
				<span>
					The elegance and accessibility of our Chardonnay is achieved with careful winemaking and blending decisions. To begin, all the grapes were harvested in the cool hours of night, followed by gentle whole cluster press. Fruit from Bien Nacido and Edna Ranch showed refreshing flavors and bright acidity that we preserved with a cool, stainless steel fermentation. To add subtle layers of spice and texture, we aged 50 percent of the wine with oak and allowed 40-percent to undergo malolactic fermentation, lending roundness and depth.

			<h3>
				<span>VINTAGE</span>
			</h3>
			<p>
				<span>
					Nearly ideal, 2013 started with an early spring and consistent temperatures throughout the summer. Like the year prior, it was fairly dry, which kept yields down and berries small. Harvest began on the earlier side and the grapes were picked at the peak of maturity, when the fruit’s natural sugars and acidity were in perfect balance.
