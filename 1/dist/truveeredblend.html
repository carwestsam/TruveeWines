						style, combining several varietals from the Central Coast into a rich, layered wine with intense character and accessible delivery. Dark fruit and effusive spices unfold in layers of blackberry, cherry, plum, spice, and cocoa. The palate is velvety and rich, with a long and lasting finish. “Like the McBride sisters themselves, this wine shows amazing style,” notes Winemaker Monica Belavic. “It combines elegance, beauty and complex flavors with an easygoing grace.”

				</h3>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size:10.5pt">
						Grapes for this wine were sourced from multiple vineyards throughout the Central Coast, each site selected for its affinity for the particular varietal. A majority of the Grenache comes from the South Hart Vineyard in San Benito, where the 40-year-old vines produce concentrated berries with amazing spice character. The Syrah is from Chalone, which has a unique <em>terroir </em>that encourages a distinctly European style with its racy acidity and deep, earthy profile. Paso Robles lived up to its reputation, delivering Zinfandel with intensely dark fruit and ripe berry character, and the Merlot gave us the leathery masculinity and deep, brooding balance that we’ve come to love from the Paris Valley Ranch Vineyard in San Lucas Valley.

					<span style="font-size:10.5pt">Winemaking</span>
				</h3>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size:10.5pt">
						An accidental masterpiece, the Red Blend delivers the style and grace the McBride Sisters intended – only it evolved out of seven varietals instead of just a couple. During winemaking, each batch was crafted to accentuate the best in that grape, including individualized yeast selection, fermentation temperatures, pump-over regime and time in oak barrels. When Winemaker Monica Belavic and the McBride Sisters sat down to taste through the wines and begin blending, each varietal popped with superb quality, begging for a larger role in the wine. In the end, they found the perfect balance of flavors and texture from multiple grapes.

				</h3>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size:10.5pt">
						Nearly ideal, 2013 started with an early spring and consistent temperatures throughout the summer. Like the year prior, it was fairly dry, which kept yields down and berries small. Harvest began on the earlier side and our red grapes were picked at the peak of maturity, when the fruit’s natural sugars and acidity were in perfect balance.
